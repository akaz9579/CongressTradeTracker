'''
ok so process, we should have some commands the user will give to the bot to ask about trades.
process should be 

1. asking about congress trades, 
2. we call congressData to webscrap from site,
3. we get tickers of what is being traded from congressdata,
4. we then pass this ticket in histoicalData, get trade context from that
5. Then display this data to the model, having it analyse the trade,
6. The model will then give some info it analyesed and give a prediction if its a good trade
